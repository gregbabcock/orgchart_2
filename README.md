Drag and drop org chart #2, [check it out here!](https://gregbabcock.github.io/orgchart_2/) Version two presents a cleaner layout; the intent is to create an org chart canvas and drag onto it the various roles that comprise your company structure. Once a role is on the canvas you would have the ability to assign people within the organization to a particular role. Roles can be added, removed, assigned to a person, placed on the canvas but unassigned to a person, re-assigned to another person or dragged onto another role to become its child along with all other children that were assigned to the role being dragged.
